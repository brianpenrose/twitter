# Twitter
 A working Twitter Replica Website.

This project was created using React and Firebase Database. The technologies used within this project are HTML,CSS,JavaScript,React, TwitterAPI's & NodeJS.

# Installation
To work with this project locally, first install all dependecies:

```npm install```
To build and run the project, project runs on port 3000.

To make the final build before pushing to production:

I recommend reading firebase docs to host and use realtime database for this project.
